# SmarterInvesting
SmarterInvesting executes the principles from fund manager Peter Lynch's mantra "Know Your Stocks" with a quiz-generator for
publiclly traded companies. Made for all ages, the SmarterInvesting app creates a portfolio for you, which you could build 
by accumulating cash and purchasing stock, all updated in realtime using the AlphaAdvantage API. The app relies on MediaWiki
API and several libraries (listed below). This app only runs on devices with a minimum API 26.
